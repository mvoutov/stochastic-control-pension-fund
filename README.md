# Stochastic Control and Pension Fund Optimization

This repository contains a graduate research project completed as part of *Financial Engineering Systems I* at the University of California, Berkeley.

Monika Voutov, Konstantin Zhivotov

## Overview
The project studies optimal asset allocation for a defined-contribution (DC) pension fund under inflation risk. A simplified single-agent version of a stochastic control framework is analyzed, inspired by Guan & Liang (2016).

## Methods
- Continuous-time stochastic control
- Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations
- CRRA utility maximization
- Inflation-indexed bonds and risky equity
- Numerical simulation via Euler–Maruyama

## Key Results
- Derived closed-form optimal allocation strategies
- Demonstrated the role of inflation-indexed bonds in preserving real wealth
- Simulations show sustained real wealth growth over long horizons
